# Basic Computer Sicence Algorithms in Python
This is a repository for implementations of some basic algorithms using python language.
So far we have implemented the following algorithms:
1. Merge Sort
2. Karatsuba Multiplication 
3. Counting Inversions


This is an ongoing project and more algorithms will be add subsequently.
