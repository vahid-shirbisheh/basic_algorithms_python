# Basic Computer Sicence Algorithms in Python
This is a repository for implementations of some basic algorithms using python language.
So far we have implemented the following algorithms:
1. Merge Sort
2. Karatsuba Multiplication 
3. Counting Inversions
4. The Strassen Matrix Multiplication (in Jupyter Notebook)
5. Closest Pair (in Jupyter Notebook)
6. Quick Sort
7. i_th smallest element of a list of numbers (using random pivots)
8. i_th smallest element of a list of numbers (using deterministic pivots)
9. The distance between vertices of a graph using Breadth-First Search strategy
10. The Distances between vertices of a (possibly disconnected) graph, again using Breadth-First Search strategy
11. The Depth First Search strategy for implementing graph algorithms
12. The decomposition of an undirected graph into connected components using the Depth First Search strategy
13. A shortest path between two vertices of an undirected graph using BFS strategy was implements
14. A simple implementation of grids using the Graph class 
15. Using graph algorithms (BSF strategy and its consequences) to solve a maze
16. ...
## Data Structures
We also implement some wellknown data structures in Python in the form of classes, such as
1. Linkedlists
2. Graphs
3. Stack
4. Queue (without using linkedlists)
5. Queuell  (queues using linkedlists) 
6. Binary Search Tree
7. ...

This is an ongoing project and more algorithms will be add subsequently. Please visit this repo again!
