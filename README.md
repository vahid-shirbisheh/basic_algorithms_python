# Basic Computer Sicence Algorithms in Python
This is a repository for implementations of some basic algorithms using python language.
So far we have implemented the following algorithms:
1. Merge Sort
2. Karatsuba Multiplication 
3. Counting Inversions
4. The Strassen Matrix Multiplication (in Jupyter Notebook)
5. Closest Pair (in Jupyter Notebook)
6. Quick Sort

This is an ongoing project and more algorithms will be add subsequently. Please visit this repo again!
