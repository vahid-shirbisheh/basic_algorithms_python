# Basic Computer Sicence Algorithms in Python
This is a repository for implementations of some basic algorithms using python language.
So far we have implemented the following algorithms:
1. Merge Sort
2. Karatsuba Multiplication 
3. Counting Inversions
4. The Strassen Matrix Multiplication (in Jupyter Notebook)
5. Closest Pair (in Jupyter Notebook)
6. Quick Sort
7. i_th smallest element of a list of numbers (using random pivots)
8. i_th smallest element of a list of numbers (using deterministic pivots)
9. ...
## Data Structures
We also implement some wellknown data structures in Python in the form of classes, such as
1. Linkedlists
2. Graphs
3. Stack
4. Queue (with and without using linkedlists)
5. ...

This is an ongoing project and more algorithms will be add subsequently. Please visit this repo again!
